## Sup Nerds âŒ‘

I like making things, I'm a fairly curious person. 

I make tools for developers, projects, and am on the Vue.js core team. I'm also [VP of Developer Experience at Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme-sd&utm_campaign=devex), a company that makes it quick and straightforward to deploy sites. I'm also a staff writer for CSS-Tricks, and wrote a book on [SVG Animations from O'Reilly](https://www.amazon.com/SVG-Animations-Implementations-Responsive-Animation/dp/1491939702). I'm a Frontend Master: I have [courses on Vue, Nuxt, SVG Animation, and Design for Developers](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/sarah-drasner/), all of the materials for which are open sourced here on GitHub.
