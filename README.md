## Sup Nerds âŒ‘

I like making things, I'm a fairly curious person. 

I'm Senior Director of Engineering, Core Infrastructure at Google. My organization is Web, Android, iOS, and Mutliplatform Development at Google, we create and support the underlying infrastructure that powers Google's apps: Search, YouTube, Workspace, etc. In my org are several open source projects such as Angular, Sass, etc, and many that are just internal.

I also make tools for developers, projects, and write some books like [Engineering Management for the Rest of Us](https://www.engmanagement.dev/) and [SVG Animations from O'Reilly](https://www.amazon.com/SVG-Animations-Implementations-Responsive-Animation/dp/1491939702), and am a Frontend Master: I have [courses on Vue, Nuxt, SVG Animation, and Design for Developers](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/sarah-drasner/), all of the materials of which are open sourced on this here site.

I used to be on the Vue.js core team, was a [VP at Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme-sd&utm_campaign=devex), and Principal IC at Microsoft.
